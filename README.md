# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

#About this Project:

This React project is a web application for managing and viewing art and craft items. It features a **Home Page** and **All Art & Craft Page** for displaying items fetched from an API. Users can **Add Craft Items**, view their own items on **My Art & Craft**, see **Single Item Details**, and **Update Data** for specific items. Authentication is handled through **Log In** and **Register** pages, with protected routes for authenticated users. An **Error Page** handles routing errors, and the project uses `react-router-dom` for routing, with an `AuthProvider` for managing user authentication context.

#This React project focuses on managing art and craft items with the following features:

1.Efficient Data Management: Utilizes React Query for efficient data fetching and caching.

2.Secure Authentication: Integrates AuthProvider for secure user authentication and authorization.

3.Smooth Navigation: Uses React Router for seamless navigation between different pages and components.

4.Interactive User Experience: Enhances user interaction through dynamic data loading and protected routes.
